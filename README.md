## Licensing

This work is released under a dual licensing scheme. See - http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/duallicence2

The GNU Public license v3 for true open source usage, and the other license is mainly for commercial purposes where the GPL does not make a good fit. 

In order to keep the dual licencing possible, code contributors to this baseline code-repository must sign their rights to us so that there is only one entity that control all the code licensing to prevent the Tradgedy of the Anticommons. See - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_anticommons
MySQL pioneered this concept and if you are reading this, you are probably aware of the great success they had beeing a part of the LAMP webserver-stack, where M is for MySQL.
